I was accepted as a Google Summer of Code Contributor to work with MDAnalysis. I am really excited to be working on a converter for OpenBabel, as this will greatly improve interoperability. I will be blogging about my journey through this experience and everything I learn on the way, and I can't wait to get stuck into some coding! There will be plenty more updates to come soon.
